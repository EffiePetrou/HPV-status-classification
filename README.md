# HPV-status-classification
Here are presented the codes and all the data that were used for the experimental part of my master thesis named "Investigation and evaluation of Radiomics, using clinical an synthetic cancer data".

The dataset involves 50 patients from the HECKTOR database. https://hecktor.grand-challenge.org/Data/

The ResNet-18 model was trained with CTs from the HECKTOR database.
The other 4 ML models were trained with the radiomic features that were extracted from a manually segmented ROI, from the CTs.
